## How is it Done?

You might be wondering how plagiarism detection on textual data is done, well it ain't as complicated as you may think.

We all know that computers are good with numbers; so in order to compute the similarity between two text documents, the textual raw data is transformed into vectors => arrays of numbers and from that, we make use of basic knowledge of vectors to compute the similarity between them.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code on this repo, you need to either *clone* or *download* this repo into your machine as shown below;

## Dependencies

Before you begin playing with the source code, you might need to install dependencies just as shown below;
using NLTK

## Running the App

To run this code you need to have your textual documents in your project directory with the **.txt** extension. When you run the script, it will automatically load all the documents with that extension and then compute the similarities between them as shown below;

```bash
 python3 plagrism_tool_hmd.py
No Plagrsim detection found
('data.txt', 'myname.txt', 0.5465972177348937)
